      <li class="font" id="textpaddingtop"> I am Antonio Roman and I'm a junior at Summit Shasta. My favorite things are food and electronics so I really like tampering with technology and and devices such as building computers and photography. I don't like to travel much I just like to explore the internet or play around with my electronics. One of my hobbies is building computers, I got into this because I always used to have a slow computer so I wanted a fast one and I really spent a lot of time of them. I looked up fast computers on youtube and stuff and I came to linus tech tips and he almost always builds his own computers so then I started making a list and it eventually became my genius project in the 10th grade. My friend also wanted to build a computer too so I picked out the parts for his computer too and then eventually during last summer we got to build them and I find it really fun. My favorite part is turning the computer on for the first time. I also play games like Dota 2, Osu! or csgo.</li>
